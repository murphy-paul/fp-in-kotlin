# Functional Programming in Kotlin

## About this repo

This repo aims to replicate the excellent book [Functional Programming in scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) By
[Paul Chiusano](https://pchiusano.github.io/) and
[RÃºnar Bjarnason](http://blog.higher-order.com/) for the
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. If you haven't done so already
I recommend you go a buy that book as it is an execellent Introduction
to functional programming an Scala. I feel such a book is just what the Kotlin
community needs, and is the reason I have created this repository.
